Exercise 1:
-----------
adder block delay = 45ns
multiplication block delay = 60ns
register CLK-to-Q delay = 10ns
setup time = 10ns
hold time = 5ns

CL delay = multiplication delay + adder delay = 105ns  
maximum clock rate = CLK-to-Q delay + CL delay + setup time = 1/125ns

Exercise 2:
-----------
CL delay = max(multiplication delay, adder delay) = 60ns 
maximum clock rate = CLK-to-Q delay + CL delay + setup time = 1/80ns
