Checkoff Question 1: because both of them highly optimizes spatial locality (strides A,B,C = 1,0,1) and temporal locality (A is cached and accessed n^2 times)
Checkoff Question 2: both of them badly utilizes spatial locality (A,B,C = 0,n,n)
Checkoff Question 3: large strides leads to high cache miss rate while small strides utilizes spaital locality and increases performance
